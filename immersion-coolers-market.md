<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Immersion Coolers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Liquid Cooling</li><li>Air Cooling</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The immersion coolers market can be categorized into liquid cooling and air cooling systems. Liquid cooling uses fluids to transfer heat away from electronic components efficiently, making it ideal for high-performance applications. These systems often utilize cooling fluids that can absorb more heat than air, resulting in better temperature management. In contrast, air cooling relies on airflow to dissipate heat, employing fans and heat sinks. While generally simpler and less costly, air cooling may be less effective for high-density setups.</p></p>
