<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Capacitive Absolute Encoders Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Turn</li><li>Multi-turn</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Capacitive absolute encoders are classified into single-turn and multi-turn types based on their measurement capabilities. Single-turn encoders measure angle within one rotation, providing high precision for applications that require positioning within a single 360-degree turn. Multi-turn encoders, on the other hand, can track multiple rotations, allowing for positioning across several turns. This distinction makes multi-turn encoders ideal for applications needing extensive rotational tracking, while single-turn encoders are suitable for simpler, single-rotation tasks.</p></p>
