<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Absorbable Cosmetic Thread Embedding Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>PDO/PPDO</li><li>PLA/PLLA</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The absorbable cosmetic thread embedding market primarily involves two key types: PDO/PPDO and PLA/PLLA threads. PDO (Polydioxanone) and PPDO (Polypropylene-dioxanone) threads are known for their biocompatibility, providing support and lifting effects while naturally decomposing over time. In contrast, PLA (Polylactic Acid) and PLLA (Poly-L-lactic Acid) threads offer similar benefits but with a different degradation process, making them suitable for longer-lasting results. Both types cater to non-surgical aesthetic procedures, enhancing facial contours and promoting collagen production.</p></p>
